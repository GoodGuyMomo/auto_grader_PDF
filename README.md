# PDF Team GitHub Guidelines

Welcome to our PDF team GitHub repository! This space will be used for sharing code and collaborating on our project. Below are the guidelines to follow:

## Branches
- Each team member has been assigned a branch. Please only upload your files to your designated branch. This ensures that everyone's individual contributions are documented and safe.

## Workflow
1. **Download the main pdf_grader.py file**: Obtain the main file from the main branch. This file will serve as your working copy.
2. **Work on your local copy**: Make your changes and additions to the downloaded file using your preferred IDE.
3. **Upload your changes**: Once you've completed your modifications, upload the edited document to your assigned branch.
4. **Make an announcement**: Notify the team that you've uploaded your changes and direct them to your branch for the most recent code.

## Weekly Updates
- Every **Thursday** night, the project manager will gather all changes made by each team member and merge them into the master document. The main branch will be updated accordingly.

## Weekly Tasks (2/25 - 2/29)
*Sunday - Thursday*

| Task Name | Assignees | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
