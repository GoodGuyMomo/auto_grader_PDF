# PDF Team GitHub Guidelines

Welcome to our PDF team GitHub repository! This space will be used for sharing code and collaborating on our project. Below are the guidelines to follow:

## Branches
- Each team member has been assigned a branch. Please only upload your files to your designated branch. This ensures that everyone's individual contributions are documented and safe.

## Workflow
1. **Download the main pdf_grader.py file**: Obtain the main file from the main branch. This file will serve as your working copy.
2. **Work on your local copy**: Make your changes and additions to the downloaded file using your preferred IDE.
3. **Upload your changes**: Once you've completed your modifications, upload the edited document to your assigned branch.
4. **Make an announcement**: Notify the team that you've uploaded your changes and direct them to your branch for the most recent code.

## Weekly Updates
- Every **Thursday** night, the project manager will gather all changes made by each team member and merge them into the master document. The main branch will be updated accordingly.

## Weekly Tasks (2/18 - 2/22)
*Sunday - Thursday*

| Task Name | Assignees | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| GUI Enhancement | Luke | Enhance the appearance of the GUI, creating a main screen with an upload PDF button. Once uploaded, transition to a screen displaying the PDF and providing space for tools and comments. |
| Comments Management | Mo, Kevin | Develop functionality for users to upload pre-written comments with associated points or write comments and assign points in real-time, saving them to a recorded document. |
| PDF Styling | Alex, Harkiran | Implement print-style rendering of the uploaded PDF instead of just displaying text. |
| Comments Display | David | Determine a method to display comments when a boundary is created or provide a simple checklist for users to select from. |

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance!

Happy coding!
